Hi, I'm Eileen. I work with organizations to build websites and applications for real people. I'm currently a UX Researcher at[Zapier][0].

## Information wrangler

Armed with a master's degree in library & information science and years of experience researching, planning, and building human-friendly interfaces, I love collaborating with diverse teams to solve messy design challenges.

I previously worked at the[University at Buffalo][1], where I was involved with the[CASE Gold award-winning UB website redesign][2], participated in an[enterprise-wide initiative][3]to overhaul the university's web communications, and implemented[content strategy processes and best practices][4].

I enjoy side projects of all kinds, from the[civic-minded][5]to the[absurd][6]. When I'm not glued to a computer screen, I sometimes[make things with my hands][7].
