Hello! Welcome

### Questions to Ask Your Users

The questions you should ask your users depend on what I'm trying to find out. I really like Google Ventures' advice to [start at the end][0] by first asking what questions you want the research to answer.

These are some of my go-to questions that I ask in nearly every session I have with users.

### Interviewing Users

\[intro\]

#### "Why?"

Getting to the root cause of a problem requires you to ask why. You can discover a person's process (or lack thereof) by asking them "why" a few times. Digging deeper on their goals helps shed light on customers' unmet needs.

**Some nice variants when you're sick of asking "Why?"**

* "Because?" I really like this as a question. It allows the speaker to go into more detail without you getting too specific.
* "What was your thinking there?"
* "Tell me more about that."

#### "Walk me through a typical day."

This is a delightfully open-ended conversation starter. The response to this introductory prompt usually hits on several points that you can jot down to follow up on later in the session.

#### "Tell me about the last time / a recent time you \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."

It's important to talk with people who have recently done the thing you are researching. The feedback you receive is likely to be much more accurate since you're not asking the user to recall an experience from a long time ago. Human memories, especially of product interactions, can quickly fade.

#### "How has the way you use/do \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ changed over time?"

By creating contrast between the past and present, this question helps shed light on the ways a person's habits may have changed or shifted over time.

### Usability Testing

\[Here are a few useful prompts for doing usability testing, or observing users\]

#### "When you \_\_\_\_\_ just now, what were you trying to do?"

This is a helpful one during usability testing to better understand user intent. I find that when a participant is really focused on or struggling with a task, they forget to think out loud. This question reminds them to verbalize their process.

### Enjoy the silence

Silence can work wonders during an interview. Sometimes it's best to not ask anything, and pause before moving on to another question. Many times, just when I'm about to move on to another question, the interviewee fills that silence with something interesting.
